## That poor occupation called engineer

I thought the exchange with my wife was funny, so I drew a comic strip out of
the conversation.

That poor occupation called engineer

On a slightly serious note, it was actually not so long ago when software
engineers solely decided how the human computer interaction should look like.
And the graphical user interface was terribly done quite often. So, even now,
we may not have a slight hesitation in blaming the engineers on subpar product
experiences.

These days, most (?) companies have UX designers and product managers.
Often, engineers' responsibility is to simply take specifications and convert
into code.

At FiveStars, we did not have a UX designer when I joined over 3 years ago. We,
handful of developers, did everything from the interaction design, asset
creation, coding, and all the way to QA and release, and perhaps even visiting
the clients for installations. Those hard and fun days are over: Now we have
whole product team comprised of talented product managers, UX designers, QA,
and engineers. The depth of the knowledge and skills they possess are humbling
me, and they put our early products to shame.

Instead of doing everything by ourselves, we work as team now. Developing a
great product takes effective cross-functional collaborations among talented
contributors. I have a great appreciation to the team especially because I
did everything by myself at least once...badly.
