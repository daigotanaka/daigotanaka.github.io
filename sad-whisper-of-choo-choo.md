## Sad whisper of "choo choo"

Today, for the first time in my life as a father, I broke a promise I made to
my daughter. It was a train ride. Today was our "bring your children to work"
day and I was going to take her to the office in the city by train. We were
already on the way to the station. But something happened at work and I had to
turn my car around to the daycare. The brain of this 2 years old was mature
enough to understand that her father could not keep the promise he made. She
looked very disappointed and sad. She kept saying "choo choo..." in a weak
voice as I was taking her out of the car seat. After dropping her at the
daycare, I was waiting for the train by myself and eating the snack I packed
for her before it goes bad. Some tears came out of my eyes.

It's been my challenge to be a decent father while being a very productive
member of the society. I have been very strategic about how I contribute at
work while securing just enough time to share the responsibility and joy as
a parent with my wife.

Today, I feel defeated. I will do better job tomorrow.
