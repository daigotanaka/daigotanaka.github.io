# A Case for Human Data Science (or why I started Anelen)

***"Machines are becoming smarter. But how can we make humans smarter?"***

This question was the main driver for me to start Anelen, a data science
consulting and service company. From personal finance to corporate strategy,
we are making tons of decisions every day. How much of our decisions are
made rationally? Are we learning from the past decisions and consequences?
Does our personal decision making skill get better over the course of our life?
How about our collective decision making ability as humankind over its history?

Machines are becoming smarter by learning from the historical data. But not so
smart enough for us to delegate everything. Reuters recently
[reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G)
that Amazon shut down its project to use machine learning to rate the job
candidates after they found that the model was biased to downgrade the female
candidates. And the main source of such bias was "because Amazonâ€™s computer
models were trained to vet applicants by observing patterns in resumes
submitted to the company over a 10-year period. Most came from men, a
reflection of male dominance across the tech industry."

This news was a lesson for every data scientist to learn from. For many,
downgrading the candidate based on the gender may look as an obvious flaw of
logic.
But the problem may be overlooked easily when one cannot think outside the belief that the better
decision is made simply from extracting the winning pattern from the historical
observation. The case of Amazon is a warning to data scientists who
thinks their job is just to optimize the hyper-parameters of the
machine-learning model for another 0.5% accuracy against a validation data set.

Machine intelligence at current form, whether it is a supervised or
unsupervised system, only learns from the historical patterns explicitly
recorded in the data. Human intelligence at its finest not only learns from the past,
but also knows how the future may be, and must be, different from the
historical patterns.

***"Helping innovative businesses make smarter decisions with data science." - Anelen's mission statement***

We often make evidence-based recommendations to the top
executives in the client companies. We have the expertise of processing data in
volume.  We have the statical knowledge to properly tell signals and noises
apart.  We have the ability to operationalize the machine learning models and
deploy them to the production. However, those are necessary but insufficient
requirements for fulfilling our data science mission. Our work requires empathy
to our client's challenges. We need to understand their value. We need to
understand the vision and goals. Only after that, our analysis and models start
to be relevant.

While the news of artificial intelligence astonishes people everyday and they
are making many people think that our intellectual activities are increasingly
being replaced by
machines, I argue that the humans are far from being able to auto-pilot
anything. If you think what deep learning is doing today, the majority of the
applications are either low level cognitive tasks, such as recognizing objects
in images, or accelerating "mechanical" decision-making process. I call it
mechanical, because those tasks are very well established based on explicit
rules or historical examples with recognized patterns.

High level cognitive tasks, on the other hand, requires more "fuzzy" human
interpretations of multi-dimensional data. It is fuzzy partly because the
utility function being maximized is often directly unobservable. Think of
consumer engagement to corporate brands for example. How deeply customer's
mind is engaged with a corporate brand is not directly observable.  If your
responsibility was to deepen the engagements, how would you measure such
hypothetical construct? Number of posts in Instagram? Maybe. Whatever you
choose to measure, the observable outcome is not the engagement itself.
It is merely a proxy variable that is assumed to be the consequence of elevated
engagement. Your assumption may be correct today, but it may a different story
tomorrow. Machine accept the objective function as is without questioning it.
This is where the resume classification goes wrong.

***"No man ever steps in the same river twice" - Heraclitus***

Humans are capable of realizing that no man ever steps in the same river twice.
The recurring patterns are different from the perfect replay of the past and
things are different moment by moment under the water. We are capable of
noticing the potential factors that changes the patterns. We can question
the established methods and decision making system.

We praise for human intelligence. But our intelligence does not seem to be
exercised as much as it should in the everyday life at all levels. In the
information era, the latest developments are impacting the business bottom line
at light speed. The human's rational decision making capability is overwhelmed
by the unprecedented amount of signals and noise. Today, cutting-edge data
processing tools must assist human cognition for all decision-making body
to thrive.

A new discipline must be in place to let us make smarter decisions in the
information era. It is called data science. It owes much to the traditional
disciplines such as statistics, but has the capacity to operate in the scale by
incorporating the computer science and software engineering.  It engineers an
unmatched efficiency by leveraging the machine learning, but also maintains the
scientific rigor from the generation of hypothesis to the assessment of bias.
The practitioners of data science must have the empathy to the human value
system and ethics and the ability to convey the message that calls the action.

**This is a case for human data science.**

Data scientists used to spend a lot of time cleansing data and tuning the
hyper-parameters of machine learning models. But more and more tools and
platforms are becoming available to automatically getting those tasks done.
Once we are free from those tasks, has the role of data scientists over then?
Far from it for Anelen as it continues to try to answer the core question -
*"Machines are becoming smarter. But how can we make humans smarter?"* - while
helping people make smarter decisions.
