## Publishing interactive data documents

![Interactive chart](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7341/15834649053_ca6a990af4_o.png)

When presented effectively, an interactive chart helps audience to grasp the
overview and in-depth look of complex data. In this article, I will show
an example of using interactive charts effectively. I also introduce R markdown
as one of the most efficient ways of authoring data rich documents.

### Motivating example

Visualizing data lets us grasp the birds-eye view of data. Suppose we made many
observations of ozone and temperature to learn about air
quality
```{r}
footnote("airquality")
```
. We can plot temperatures (F) and ozone level (ppb) on
x and y axes, respectively as in Fig.  `r fn()`. Just by looking at the plot, we
gain a little insight on the relationship between the two measurements.


```{r, html.cap=fn("Ozone level and temperature")}
# Plot air quality
ozone_temp
```

More sophisticated visualization can present higher dimensional data on a flat
paper: it explains not only the relationship between x and y, but also y and z,
z and x, and so on. We can add the measurements of wind speed (mph) to our
plot (Fig. `r fn()`).

```{r, html.cap=fn("Ozone level, temperature, and wind speed. Lighter blue indicates higher wind speed.")}
# Plot with wind speed
ozone_temp_wind
```

In the plot, I showed the wind temperature in shades of blue. Lighter blue
indicates higher wind speed. We can observe that the wind speed tends to be
low when the ozone level is high.

After grasping the overview of the data, we may want to look into the
details of particular parts of the data. What if we want to know the date of the
observation of the highest point of ozone level? The graph on a paper is not
ideal place to make the transition between the overview and in-depth look.
Fortunately, we use computer screens to view the graph more often these days.
You can hover the mouse cursor over Fig. `r fn()` to reveal the date of the
observation.

```{r, html.cap=fn("Interactive chart of ozone level, temperature, and wind speed. Hover the mouse cursor over to reveal the date.")}
renderChart(ozone_chart, chartId="ozone", include_assets = TRUE, cdn = TRUE)
```

### Interactive chart with R-markdown

The interactive visualizations on New York Times articles
```{r}
footnote("nyt")
```
are the sophisticated
example you may be already familiar.

It used to require a set of skills such as database (e.g. SQL),
back-end processing (Python, Ruby, nose.js, and etc), front-end web
application coding (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) to create such interactive
visualizations.

Thanks to the recent developments such as rCharts, it is now much easier to
author and publish data rich documents in
[R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

With R markdown, one can:

- Load and transform data from multiple sources
- Run statistical analysis
- Produce figures
- Write narratives

Within a single text file. Having to hop around different programs to do those
activities can be very disruptive to thought process. With R markdown, we
can focus on the research without being distracted by how each tool works.

### R-markdown example: Twitter impressions and engagements

Figure `r fn()` is a demonstration of using R-markdown to visualize my twitter
activities in 2014. X axis is time. Y axis is the number of impressions (i.e.
how many people saw each of my tweets.) It is a bubble chart, and the size of
each bubble represents the number of engagements (i.e. the total number of
viewer's activities such as clicking the profile or links, and expanding the
tweets.)

```{r,  html.cap=fn("Interactive chart: Daigo's twitter impressions and engagements in 2014. The size of the bubble coresponds to the number of engagements. Hover the mouse cursor over to reveal the details.")}
renderChart(twitter_chart, chartId="twitter", include_assets = TRUE, cdn = TRUE)
```

Bubble chart is one of the effective methods to visualize the relationship
between three variables. The chart above is also colored to distinguish
the tweets in English and Japanese. With this presentation, you may easily
notice that the majority of my tweets are in English.

After getting the overview of how the impressions, the engagements and frequency
of the tweets in each language, I may want to find out what tweet actually got
very high or low impressions or
engagements. In this chart, hovering the mouse over a bubble will reveal the
content of each tweet. Each group can be toggled on and off, and the chart
adjusts the zoom automatically.

Once data is prepared, it only took 8 lines of R code to generate the chart
with the help of [rCharts](http://ramnathv.github.io/rCharts/) package and
[the reusable helper function](https://gist.github.com/daigotanaka/63911907d6ceebe54a74)

### Conclusions

With the help of packages such as rCharts, it is now much easier to publish data
rich documents. R markdown let one focus on the data analysis and production of
the manuscript without requiring in-depth knowledge of programming languages.
Properly presented interactive charts help the online publishers to communicate
interpretation of the data effectively.
