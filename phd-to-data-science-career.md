# How a Ph.D. gets a Data Scientist job

Data Science jobs [continue to increase in
2017](http://r4stats.com/2017/03/13/jobs-for-data-science-up-7-fold-for-statistician-down-by-half/),
yet switching one's job title to Data Scientist can be very challenging like
any other mid-career transformations especially from academia.

I think there are 3 parts involved before one lands on a job:

1. Gain the basic skill set
2. Do projects
3. Overcome Catch 22

I will write my thoughts on each part in this post.

## Gain the basic skill set

Most Data Scientist positions are posted by industry. The modern industries are
increasingly becoming data dependent. More industries are adopting the proven
big data infrastructures and are seeking the Data Scientists with the relevant
skill sets. You want to make sure you acquire at least a few.

Insight Data Science had [a very good blog
post](http://r4stats.com/2017/03/13/jobs-for-data-science-up-7-fold-for-statistician-down-by-half/)
to list the skills and how you can learn. Check out.

### Good news for people with Ph.D.

Although those skills are crucial in getting things done at an industrial role,
the most important skill is missing from the Insight's blog post: Science.
Many of people with a Ph.D. training can carefully observe, form hypotheses,
and design a study to test. This is a crucial skill to conduct anything beyond
descriptive analytics.

## Do projects

You need to demonstrate that you can get the real work done using the skill set.
As an industrial Data Scientist, your target audience is business decision
makers, not academic researchers. So, choose your project that is relevant to
them and present the project according to their viewpoint. Do not write an
academic paper or presentation.

Some of the questions you might have to answer as a Data Scientist could be:

- How can we estimate the impact of the price increase of a product?
- How can we predict the cancellation of a subscription service?
- How can we measure the impact of a new product release?

It might be hard to get a data set to run such project, even for answering a
hypothetical question. If you are already working in an industry, you may be
able to acquire such data by proposing a side project.

The point is that you need to demonstrate that you can deliver actual
business values by answering key questions based on your data science skills.

## Overcome Catch 22

It is probably easier to get another Data Science position if you already are a
Data Scientist in the current company.

There are also many Data Scientist training programs now especially in the US
including Master's degree course. Getting a formal academic degree in Data
Science or a similar program might be beneficial in getting junior data
scientist positions. So, it might make sense for the people early in their
careers especially if they are still in the process of acquiring the skills.
On the other hand, if you already possess the skills, enrolling in those
courses just to get a degree or certificate does not make sense to me
considering the time and money you need to spend.

Can you instead first propose a side project in the current position, and
present the value of Data Science effort to the company so that you will be
the first Data Scientist? Even if you cannot get the official title, your
company or manager may assign you to a Data Science project. Even if does not
happen, you have a project that you could present to get another job position.

Alternatively, Insight Data Science and other similar program offer
an interesting solution for selected talents. Instead of offering course work,
they offer an opportunity to work on a data science project, possibly with
their partner companies, and the fellows present the project to the partner
companies at the end of a relatively short (2~3 months) project. They seem to
have high job placement rate in this way.

## Conclusion

Despite the increasing demand, switching one's job title to a Data Scientist
could be a big challenge. If you are very new to the field, it may make sense
to enroll in graduate school or certificate courses. If you already have most
skills, you may want to focus on doing projects to show off. It would be much
better if the project actually answers business critical questions. This is
still a wild west of a job trend and you may want to be bold and creative as to
propose your current company to create a job position for you.
