## Bitcoin donation experience #2: HandUp.org

> ### This is the second time I donated with Bitcoin. With the ease of QR code and instant Bitcoin transaction, I could donate with confidence and it was a fun experience.

I found about [HandUp.org](http://handup.org) through an online
article[^upworthy], and I loved the idea. I commute to San Francisco, and
I see many homeless people living in harsh conditions. I also volunteered
several times to serve basic needs for those who are struggling[^volunteer].

To start, I wanted to make a small donation immediately. HandUp.org enables
us to make donations to specific people raising money for specific goals
from the basic needs to education to get back to work. They make sure the
money donated is used for the specific purpose. Since I did not have particular
person to help in my mind this time, I chose to donate to so-called "The 
National Fund" that will go to those with the most urgent needs.

I was also happy to find that the donor also can opt in to add $5 to support
HandUp.org so it can sustain and grow the donation platform. [^support]

After choosing to donate with Bitcoin[^monthly], it opens a window with a QR 
code:

I have Coinbase app installed on my smartphone, and just by scanning
the code, the donation was sent, and instantaneously reflected on HandUp.org
page.

This is the second time 
[I donated with Bitcoin](http://www.daigotanaka.org/my-first-bitcoin-donation/).
With the ease of QR code and instant Bitcoin transaction, I could donate with
confidence and it was a fun experience[^experience].

If you would like to try out Bitcoin donation yourself, you can create a
Bitcoin wallet for free at [coinbase](https://coinbase.com), and buy any amount
of Bitcoin, even a tiny fraction of a Bitcoin, and store it securely there.

[^upworthy]: Here is the [link](http://www.upworthy.com/if-youre-like-me-when-homeless-people-ask-for-money-you-just-cant-heres-a-much-better-idea) to the article on Upworthy.
[^volunteer]: I volunteered at [St. Anthony's](http://www.stanthonysf.org/) in Tenderloin district of San Francisco a couple of times by serving food and cleaning up the facility. I also sorted donated food at [SF-Marine Food Bank](http://www.sfmfoodbank.org). I learned a lot through those activities, and got to talk to homeless people at St. Anthony's. They all have lives and story to tell.
[^monthly]: As of today, the donation with Bitcoin is not supported for monthly donation.
[^support]: One interesting fact is that HandUp.org is a for-profit organization, and [they are not shy about it](https://handup.org/blog/for-profit-for-good). I fully support this idea so that they can scale their mission most effectively. According to the website, 80% of the donors choose to support HandUp.org.
[^experience]: Again, I usually do not talk about my donation activities, but I like to promote donation via Bitcoin, so this is another exception.
