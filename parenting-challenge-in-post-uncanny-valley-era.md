## The parenting challenge in post uncanny valley era

I showed the picture of a girl to Yvonne. Her response was "Who's that?" So, I
said "No body".

It was a picture of a girl in a white shirt with a stripe tie. Her name is
Saya. She looked like an ordinal highschool girl, except that she was modeled
with Maya, a 3D computer graphics modeling software.

Modeling a realistic person like Saya takes hours of work by a skilled computer
artist. It would still look unnatural she moves. But I have a feeling that the
uncanny valley [^uncanny] is being rapidly overcome on computer screen. And
there is an unprecedented advancement in Artificial Intelligence and
man-machine interaction through spoken natural language. All integrated
together, I bet there will a day in our life time when we have hard time
telling machine and human apart.

It will be hard especially for young children to tell such difference. Today,
we talk about digital native generation. We will probably be talking AI native
generation one day. As a brand new parent with a lot of imagination, I have
to wonder if my baby one day insists that her best friend is a non-human
character. How would react to such a strange idea to the people from the old
world. How should I response wisely as a parent? It may be the way to admit
that AI character is a character. But what if an innocent looking young
character appears in front of my daughter and trick her to try some dangerous
drug with a clever AI logic? What if she decides to marry the character?

Perhaps for Japanese people, the concern is not totally of science fiction.
There was a groom who invited his ex-girlfriend to his wedding. That already
sounds like a terrible idea, but the ex-girlfriend is a virtual girlfriend in
Nintendo DS (The bride reportedly ended up "killing" her by smashing his DS
with a hammer at the wedding [^groom].) In another wedding, a male invitee
was said to have insisted that he'd bring his 2D girlfriend (again in DS)
and that she'd participate in the bouquet toss 

As the technology really overcomes the uncanny valley at all levels. Problem
will soon be not just for anime addicted few.
